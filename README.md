# Arrayan

Arrayan is a Food Supply Chain application built on the blockchain fabric of ResilientDB that tracks the products, by-products, and process history through the Food Supply Chain.

- Web Application: Built using React JS, [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [React Official Website](https://react.dev/)
- Database: Powered by [ResilientDB](https://resilientdb.com/)
- Theme: BLK Design System React, [BLK Design System Pro React](https://demos.creative-tim.com/blk-design-system-pro-react/?_ga=2.58939236.839164262.1702005007-948628969.1702005007#/presentation)

## Modifications

We have modified the existing [ResilientDB GraphQL APIs](https://github.com/ResilientApp/ResilientDB-GraphQL) catering the needs of a blockchain-based food supply chain and added a new API to fetch the products in the [forked repo](https://github.com/Amoolya-Reddy/ResilientDB-GraphQL)

    cd arrayan

Install the dependencies:
    
    npm install

Start the project:
    
    npm start

Build the project:
    
    npm run build

The above code uses online instance of ResilientDB and the application is ready to be launched. For further exploration, below steps can be followed to setup and play around with local instance.

### Setup Python3.10
Ensure you have Python3.10, otherwise download it and set it up as default.

### Setup ResilientDB
You will need to clone the ResilientDB repo to get started:

    git clone https://github.com/resilientdb/resilientdb.git

Then navigate inside the ResilientDB directory:
    
    cd resilientdb

Install dependencies:
    
    sh INSTALL.sh

Run ResilientDB KV Service (this may take a few minutes for the first time):
    
    ./service/tools/kv/server_tools/start_kv_service.sh

### Setup Crow HTTP server, SDK, and GraphQL server
You will need to clone the ResilientDB GraphQL repo to get started:
    
    git clone https://github.com/Amoolya-Reddy/ResilientDB-GraphQL
    
Then navigate inside the ResilientDBGraphQL directory:
    
    cd ResilientDB-GraphQL

Install the Crow dependencies:
    
    sudo apt update sudo apt install build-essential sudo apt install python3.10-dev sudo apt install apt-transport-https curl gnupg

Build Crow HTTP server (this may take a few minutes for the first time):
   
    bazel build service/http_server:crow_service_main

Start the Crow HTTP server:
    
    bazel-bin/service/http_server/crow_service_main service/tools/config/interface/service.config service/http_server/server_config.config

Create virtual environment for the Python SDK:
    
    python3 -m venv venv –without-pip

Activate the virtual environment:
    
    source venv/bin/activate

Install pip in the virtual environment for the Python dependencies:
    
    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python

Install the Python dependencies:
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Start the GraphQL server:
    
    python3 app.py
